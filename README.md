## Introduction

Toolkit-thunk-flight-radar provides real-time tracking of flights on an interactive map. Users can:

- Track the selected airplane's route on the map.
- Access detailed flight information such as:
   - Departure and arrival airports
   - Aircraft type
   - Aircraft code
   - Airline
   - Departure and arrival times.
   - View a list of flights within a specific location, based on API-defined boundaries, through a user-friendly list page.
   - The list page includes all flights, and with React Paginate, users can easily navigate through the flights in a paginated, user-friendly interface.
   - Fetch various data from the API, which can be customized to display additional information as needed.

This application offers a user-friendly interface, combining real-time flight tracking with an intuitive list of flights and map-based tracking.
